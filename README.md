# Exploits - PoC Scripts
This is a small repository of exploit PoC (Proof of Concept) Scripts that were programmed by me for educational purposes and uploaded here. In each file the operating system of the attacker, the operating system of the victim and the download to the file is described. As a small overview here is a small list with the exploits and descriptions. Of course everything is sorted.

## Files
Here are quick table with the name of the exploit and the count in this repository.
| Name                                          | Count |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| Stack-based Buffer Overflow                   | 3     |
| Stack-based Buffer Overflow (with DEP Bypass) | 1     |
| Structured Exception Handler (SEH) Overwrite  | 2     |
